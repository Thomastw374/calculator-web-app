# calculator-web-app

The enclosed project a constitutes a simple calculator. Able to perform the 4 basic operations, multiplication, divison, addition and subtraction.

This was created without the use of the eval() function due to it's inherent security flaws, potentially allowing for code injection attacks. Similarly, Function() could have been used here but I decided to opt for a more roundabout method to test my basic javascript skills.
