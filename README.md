# calculator-web-app

The enclosed project a constitutes a simple calculator. Able to perform the 4 basic operations, multiplication, divison, addition and subtraction.

This was created without the use of the eval() function due to it's inherent security flaws, for one potentially allowing for code injection attacks. Function() could have similarly been used here but I decided to opt for a more roundabout method to test my basic javascript skills.
